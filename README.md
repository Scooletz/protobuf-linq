What is protobuf-linq?
=============

*Protobuf-linq* is a LINQ extension over the [protobuf-net](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/) library.
The _protobuf-linq_ library provides much faster querying over big streams of data. You can for instance provide types with fewer properties to speed up deserialization but why not delegate this task to a separate library?

How can I learn it?
=============

It isn't hard, it's LINQ after all. Just take a look at [wiki](https://github.com/Scooletz/protobuf-linq/wiki)

Where can I get it?
=============

Get it from NuGet. You can simply install it with the Package Manager console:
    
    PM> Install-Package protobuf-linq

*Protobuf-linq, because querying can be faster!*
